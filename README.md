# Tranquillity: Clean Air Locator

## Overview
The **Tranquillity: Clean Air Locator** is a web application that helps users find and navigate to nearby locations with better air quality. Using real-time air quality data from APIs, the application provides a curated list of cleaner locations with distance. With integrated Google Maps navigation, users can seamlessly get directions from their current location to a selected cleaner spot, promoting a healthier lifestyle.

## Features
- **Real-Time Air Quality Data**: Fetches live air quality data from reliable APIs.
- **Geolocation-Based Recommendations**: Displays nearby locations with better air quality based on user input.
- **Navigation Support**: Allows users to start navigation directly to the selected location via Google Maps.
- **Dynamic List Updates**: Automatically updates the list when a new location is entered, ensuring a clean and accurate display.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **APIs**:
  	-OpenStreetMap (via Leaflet.js): This is used for map rendering and adding markers.
	-World Air Quality Index API (WAQI): Used to fetch air quality data.
	-Nominatim API (from OpenStreetMap): Used to geocode the userâ€™s input location.


## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Enter a starting location to search for cleaner air spots.
2. **Air Quality Data Fetching**: The app retrieves real-time air quality data for the specified area.
3. **List Generation**: Displays a list of cleaner locations with details like distance and a navigation link.
4. **Google Maps Integration**: Click the navigation link to open Google Maps and start navigating from the entered location.
